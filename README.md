# Matrix Partition Method

## Overview

The Matrix Partition Method is used when dealing with very large matrices that cannot be stored entirely in the primary memory of a computer at once. This method is also beneficial when additional variables and equations are added to the original system.

## Matrix Partitioning

Let the coefficient matrix A  be partitioned as:

A = [B C][D E]


where B is an I × I matrix, C is an I × m matrix, D is an m x I and E is an m X m
matrix; and I, m are positive integers with I + m = n.


## Inverse Partitioning

Let the inverse of A , denoted  A^{-1} , be partitioned as:

A^{-1} = [P Q][R S]

## Algorithm to Solve a Given Problem

1. **Partition the Matrix**: 
   Divide matrix $$ A $$ into four smaller matrices: $$ B $$, $$ C $$, $$ D $$, and $$ E $$.

2. **Divide the Inverse**: 
   Take the inverse of the original matrix $$ A $$ and divide it into four matrices $$ P $$, $$ Q $$, $$ R $$, and $$ S $$.

3. **Solve for Submatrices**: 
   Calculate $$ P $$, $$ Q $$, $$ R $$, and $$ S $$.

4. **Substitute Values**: 
   Substitute the values of $$ P $$, $$ Q $$, $$ R $$, and $$ S $$ into the matrix.

5. **Compute $$ X $$**: 
   Finally, solve for $$ X = \text{inverse}(A)B $$.

## Advantages

This method provides a systematic way to handle large matrices by breaking them down into manageable submatrices, which allows for efficient computation of the inverse.

## Applications

- Solving large systems of linear equations
- Handling matrices too large to fit in computer memory
- Efficiently updating solutions when new variables or equations are added to the system
