# MATRIX PARTITION METHOD

When a matrix is very large and it is not possible to store the entire matrix in the primary memory of a computer at once, the matrix partition method is used to find the inverse of a matrix. This method is also useful when additional variables and equations are added to the original system.

Let the coefficient matrix \( A \) be partitioned as:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} B & C \\ D & E \end{bmatrix}
\]

where:
- \( B \) is an \( I \times I \) matrix,
- \( C \) is an \( I \times m \) matrix,
- \( D \) is an \( m \times I \) matrix,
- \( E \) is an \( m \times m \) matrix,

and \( I \) and \( m \) are positive integers such that \( I + m = n \).

Let the inverse of \( A \), denoted \( A^{-1} \), be partitioned as:

\[
A^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} P & Q \\ R & S \end{bmatrix}
\]

## Algorithm to Solve a Given Problem

1. **Partition the Matrix**: Divide matrix \( A \) into four smaller matrices, namely \( B \), \( C \), \( D \), and \( E \).
2. **Divide the Inverse**: Take the inverse of the original matrix \( A \) and divide it into four matrices \( P \), \( Q \), \( R \), and \( S \).
3. **Solve for Submatrices**: Calculate \( P \), \( Q \), \( R \), and \( S \).
4. **Substitute Values**: Substitute the values of \( P \), \( Q \), \( R \), and \( S \) into the matrix.
5. **Compute \( X \)**: Finally, solve for \( X = \text{inverse}(A)B \).

This method provides a systematic way to handle large matrices by breaking them down into manageable submatrices, which allows for efficient computation of the inverse.
