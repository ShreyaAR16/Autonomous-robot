# Matrix Partition Method

## Overview

The Matrix Partition Method is used when dealing with very large matrices that cannot be stored entirely in the primary memory of a computer at once. This method is also beneficial when additional variables and equations are added to the original system.

## Matrix Partitioning

Let the coefficient matrix A  be partitioned as:

A = [B C][D E]


where B is an I × I matrix, C is an I × m matrix, D is an m x I and E is an m X m
matrix; and I, m are positive integers with I + m = n.


## Inverse Partitioning

Let the inverse of A , denoted  A^{-1}, be partitioned as:

A^{-1} = [P Q][R S]

## Algorithm to Solve a Given Problem

Step 1: Divide matrix A into 4 smaller matrices namely B, C, E, and D.

Step 2: Take the inverse of the original matrix A and divide it into another 4 matrices X, Y, Z and V.

Step 3: Solve for V, Y, Z and X.

Step 4: Substitute the values of V, Y, Z and X into the matrix.

Step 5: Solve for X = inverse(A)B


## Advantages

This method provides a systematic way to handle large matrices by breaking them down into manageable submatrices, which allows for efficient computation of the inverse.

## Applications

- Solving large systems of linear equations
- Handling matrices too large to fit in computer memory
- Efficiently updating solutions when new variables or equations are added to the system
